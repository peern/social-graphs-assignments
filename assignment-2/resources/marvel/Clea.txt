'''Doctor Clea Strange''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|iː|ə}}) is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is a [[magic (paranormal)|sorceress]] and the disciple, lover, and eventual wife of [[Doctor Strange|Doctor Stephen Strange]], and his ultimate successor as '''Sorcerer Supreme'''. Created by co-plotters [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], Clea [[first appeared]] in the Doctor Strange feature in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 (November 1964).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=85}}</ref>

Clea is a human-appearing being and maternally related to the other-dimensional Faltine race of energy beings. The daughter of [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] and the niece of the demonic tyrant [[Dormammu]], the noble Clea has been, sporadically, ruler of the Dark Dimension, the mystical realm to which Dormammu had been banished and which he subsequently conquered.

The character was portrayed by [[Anne-Marie Martin]] (credited as Eddie Benton) in the 1978 television film ''[[Dr. Strange (1978 film)|Dr. Strange]]''. [[Charlize Theron]] portrays her in a mid-credit scene in the 2022 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''.<ref name="CleaTheron" />

==Publication history==
The character was introduced during a [[story arc]] in which Doctor Strange confronted Dormammu for the first time. Clea remained nameless for several issues, referred to only as of the "captive female", or the "mysterious silver-haired girl". It was later noted that her father is Dormammu's closest disciple.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #132</ref> Her name was eventually revealed two years later.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #146 (July 1966)</ref>

Initially, nothing indicates that Clea and Umar are related to or even know each other.<ref>'' Strange Tales'' #150-156</ref> Indeed, Dormammu's sister mimics her brother's tactics and goes after Clea as a way of hurting Strange. Later, it was revealed that Umar was her mother and that her father was Orini, a disciple of Dormammu and ruler of the Dark Dimension.

In 2004, Clea appeared in the ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' series along with [[Jennifer Kale]], [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]], and [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]].

[[Brian Michael Bendis]] has described Clea as: "...the mistress of the Dark Dimension and...Strange’s ex-girlfriend/wife. She was trained by Strange, right there in his home. She was his prized pupil. She was to Strange what he was to the Ancient One [Strange’s instructor in the mystic arts]. But as Mistress of the Dark Dimension, she hasn’t been on this plane of existence a lot lately. And who’s going to take her serious{{sic}} in those pants?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20145 |title=Who Is the Next Sorcerer Supreme? |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2009-02-23 |access-date=2011-04-06}}</ref>

Following the 2021 Death of Doctor Strange event, Clea becomes the official Sorcerer Supreme in her own solo series, ''Strange'', written by [[Jed MacKay]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/clea-to-replace-doctor-strange-as-the-sorceress-supreme/ | title=Clea to Replace Doctor Strange as the Sorceress Supreme | date=14 December 2021 }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Clea observed [[Doctor Strange]] in the [[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]], impressed by his courage. She warned Strange against facing [[Dormammu]], and Dormammu punished her for her betrayal. Strange forced him to release her.<ref>'' Strange Tales'' #126-127</ref> She became Strange's only ally in the Dark Dimension, and soon became a captive of her uncle.

[[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] took Clea hostage and nearly killed her. The [[Ancient One]] sent Clea into a pocket dimension to save her from Umar.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #150-155</ref> Clea was found and freed by Doctor Strange, and went to live on Earth with him.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #171-173</ref>

Clea was later captured by [[Silver Dagger (comics)|Silver Dagger]]. Doctor Strange's spirit cohabited in her body so that they could defeat Silver Dagger.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #1-2, 4-5</ref> Umar then attacked Clea on Earth, and Clea battled her.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #6, 9</ref>

Clea helped save herself from being sacrificed by Dormammu and came to believe [[Morganna Blessing]] loved Strange more than she did.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #51</ref> Clea and Strange later helped lead a rebellion in the Dark Dimension. Clea discovered that Umar was her mother, and Clea defeated Umar in a mystic battle. Clea revealed to the inhabitants of the Dark Dimension that her mother didn't care for her subjects at all and was willing to endanger them to defeat Clea. The population became convinced that Clea should be the ruler and the "Flames of Regency" appeared on Clea's head. The Flames of Regency made Clea powerful enough to defeat and banish Umar and her father Orini from the Dark Dimension, and Clea took the throne of the Dark Dimension.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #69-74</ref>

Clea and Strange exchanged vows and became one according to the laws of the Dark Dimension.<ref>'' Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #3</ref> Several months later, Dormammu returned to the Dark Dimension and claimed the throne again. Clea was held hostage to lure in Doctor Strange, but Strange and Clea managed to escape Dormammu and arrived near Umar. Umar tried to kill Strange but found out that her spells hurt both Clea and Strange. Clea revealed to her mother that she had married Strange. Umar confessed that she didn't want to hurt her daughter and assisted Doctor Strange and Clea in defeating Dormammu. Umar and her new lover [[Baron Mordo]] claimed rulership over the Dark Dimension but promised Clea that they would not abuse their powers. Clea reluctantly agreed and returned to Earth with Strange.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #21-25</ref>

Sometime later, the Faltinean Flyx appeared to her and told her that Umar and Mordo betrayed her trust. Clea and Flyx gathered an army to defeat Umar and Mordo, but Flyx revealed himself to be Dormammu in disguise. He absorbed the powers of Umar and Mordo and Clea remained in the Dark Dimension as leader of the resistance against Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 3 #48</ref>

Doctor Strange told the Illuminati of how Clea left him to lead the rebellion in the Dark Dimension.<ref>''The New Avengers Illuminati'' #4</ref>

Clea returns and it is revealed that she has been hiding out in Odin's hall thanks to [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], who comes to ask a favour of her to restore the recently deceased Annabelle Riggs to life. After performing a spell to resurrect her, which causes Annabelle and Valkyrie to share a body, Clea leaves with them to possibly join the [[Fearless Defenders|Defenders]] team.<ref>''The Fearless Defenders'' #7</ref>

During the "Death of Doctor Strange" storyline, Clea falls from a portal in the sky and is caught by Classic Doctor Strange. Wong then briefs her on what happened to Doctor Strange. Clea then states to him and everyone present that the inter-dimensional warlords like Aggamon, Dagoth, Tiboro, and Umar are fleeing from the Three Mothers. When the Three Mothers arrive, Clea witnesses the Avengers' disastrous fight with them before the Three Mothers retreat vowing to come back for them later.<ref>''Death of Doctor Strange'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Strange, Wong and Clea team up to defeat the Three Mothers though Strange dies permanently and bequeaths the title of Sorcerer Supreme to Clea. [[Doctor Doom]] arrives at the Sanctum and demands to know how Clea has become the Sorcerer Supreme through unconventional means, though Clea refuses to reveal the information. Against Wong's advice, Clea attempts to resurrect Strange.<ref>''Strange'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Clea is the Sorceress Supreme of the Dark Dimension, possessing vast powers involving the manipulation of the forces of magic for a variety of effects. She has exhibited such abilities as transmutation, forming and throwing magical bolts of concussive energy, magically constructed animate beings, conjuring objects and energies, teleporting, telekinesis, levitation, mesmerism, thought-casting, controlling others' minds, casting illusions, and the tapping of extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. Presumably, she is capable of replicating any spell performed by her former mentor, Doctor Strange. As she is descended from the Faltine race of beings, it is suggested that she can generate her own mystical energy, like Umar and Dormammu, and draw upon it to fuel her magic. She also possesses greater strength and body density than that of a normal Earth human. Her age is indeterminate and the rate at which she ages is unknown since she has lived for centuries but has the form and demeanour of a twenty-year-old woman. Clea has defeated the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] in single magical combat, and armed with the Flames of Regency, at the peak of her magical abilities, even rivalled her mother [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] in raw power.

Clea possesses a vast knowledge of magical lore through extensive studies of sorcery under Doctor Strange, who also trained her in hand-to-hand combat.

Eventually, Doctor Strange (feeling regret at his apparent emotional neglect of her) travels to Asgard with Xen (an Asian team of super-beings), to free her. He succeeds and attempts to rekindle the love between them, but Clea rejects him saying that he still does not understand her.<ref>'' Earth X'' (1999){{Issue|date=March 2010}}</ref>
